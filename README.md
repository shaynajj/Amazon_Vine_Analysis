- 42.2% of Vine reviews were 5-stars and 46.9% of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars.

### Summary
There does not appear to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Although there is not a big difference in the percentage of 5-star Vine review versus 5-star non-Vine reviews, it is noted that there is a higher percentage of 5-star reviews for non-Vine program reviews. Another analysis could be done to compare 1-star reviews as well the exact way to see if there are major differences for a different star rating.
